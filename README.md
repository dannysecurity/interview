# Interview Demo

This repository contains a simple projectile simulation written in vanilla JavaScript. The `src/index.html` file presents controls for speed and angle, and a canvas that displays the resulting trajectory. Use the **Play** button to run a new simulation and **Replay** to redraw the last shot.

Open `src/index.html` in any modern browser to test the app.
